## Development Platform

* __Realbasic 5.5__  
  The last IDE used to develop LameBrain was RB5.5.  It may or may not work in newer versions


## Required Plugins

See the Docs for more information on what plugins were used.  Unfortunately, the Mac-X-Software plugins, including DrawControl, IconLib and MacXLib, do not seem to be available anymore.  If someone locates copies of these, I'd consider including them in this release.

## Why Now?

It's been (ugh) nearly 4 years since LameBrain was updated.  It was an enjoyable project, but I simply lost interest: I didn't use the program myself, moving to encoding most of my music with the iTunes AAC encoder.  I also had pushed the app feature wise as far as I ever intended.

Still, people continue to search for and download LameBrain every day from funkatron.com.  It evidently scratches an itch for some people, and that's a source of pride for me.  So I'd hate to just sit on the program and not give others an opportunity to run with it.  I think there are some valuable bits in the horribly structured code I wrote back then, and maybe someone with more drive than me will build on what's here.
