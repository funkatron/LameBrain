# LameBrain: An OS X GUI frontend for LAME

*Last updated: 2022-07-22 - EF*

----

## _Note_: this is not a working app on MacOS at this time. I think the last version it worked on was OS X 10.6.

----

This is the source code, for the last version of LameBrain I released.  The source code is the `LameBrain_0.6.2_opensource.rb` file, which is a binary format only readable by the [RealBasic](https://www.xojo.com/) ***5.5*** IDE, as far as I know. It may or may not work in newer versions.

## Want to help?
- [ ] It would be cool to decompile the `.rb` file to read the source code.
- [ ] Can you get it running? I would love to see video of it! See my contact info below.

## Required Plugins

See [readme.rtf](readme.rtf) for more information on what plugins were used.  Unfortunately, the Mac-X-Software plugins, including DrawControl, IconLib and MacXLib, do not seem to be available anymore (and I last checked in 2007).
